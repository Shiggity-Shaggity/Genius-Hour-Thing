//if statments are basically the same as Java's if statments so I don't really need to go much more into it but this is what it
//would look like I guess
//also declaring integers 
int a;
a = 1;
// "int" tells the computer that you are declaring a new integer variable or a whole number and the "a" is the name of the variable
// and "1" is basically the value assigned to "a" so that you can use it and change it. An example using an if statement below.

if(a=1){
  a++;
} else {
  //if the parameters are false then anything in these brackets will be run
}

//The parenthesis next to "if" is where the parameters for the command go. "a=1" are the parameters, this checks if the "a" variable
//is equal to one and if so it does what is in the brackets, which is add 1 to the "a" variable and if not, the program goes to else.


#include <iostream> // this is required to compile the program.
using namespace std; // Tells the compiler to use the specified namespace. CANT FIND A gOOD DEFINITION FOR NAMESPACE

int main() {                 //"int main()" tells the computer that this is the main statment to run from when the program starts.
   cout << "Hello World";    //prints "Hello World" into the console when the program runs.
   return 0;                 //This returns 0 and ends the statement.
}

//While loops take a true or false parameter and repeats whatever is in the brackets as long as the parameter is true.

while(a=2){
  a++
}
// if the while loop and the if statement above were in the same main function [int main()] then the parameter in the while statement
is true and it would continuously add 1 to the "a" variable forever.
