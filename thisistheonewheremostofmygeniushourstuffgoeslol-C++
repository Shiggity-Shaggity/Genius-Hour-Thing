//if statments are basically the same as Java's if statments so I don't really need to go much more into it but this is what it
//would look like I guess
//also defining integers 
int a = 1;
// "int" tells the computer that you are defining a new integer variable or a whole number and the "a" is the name of the integer
// and "1" is basically the value assigned to "a" so that you can use it and change it. An example using an if statement below.

if(a=1){
  a++;
} else {
  //if the parameters are false then anything in these brackets will be run
}

//The parenthesis next to "if" is where the parameters for the command go "a=1" are the parameters, this checks if the "a" variable
//is equal to one and if so it does what is in the brackets, which is add 1 to the "a" variable.
